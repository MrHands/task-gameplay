# Up There They Love - Gameplay Prototype

Due to a series of _hilarious_ mishaps that would take too long to get into here, you have been put in charge of the space ship _Love Itself_. This vessel has a prototype engine installed, called the **S.E.X. drive**, and is powered by **sexual energy**, or _sexergy_.

As the **captain**, it is your responsibility to **manage** your **crew members** by assigning **tasks** to them during their shifts. You need to generate as much **sexergy** as possible so the ship can keep flying!

## Day shift

During the _Morning_, _Afternoon_, and _Evening_ shifts, you assign each crew member to a task. The tasks have a **difficulty** and the crew member rolls a 1d20 to determine if they succeed, fail, or have a critical success. You can **bet crew stamina** to improve your odds. But be careful! Characters without any stamina remaining can only perform a _Rest_ task to restore it.

## Night shift

At the start of the _Night_, you pick a crew member to have sex with. You can then perform sex moves to generate **sexergy**.

When the crew member's lust bar reaches 200%, they orgasm. This doubles the sexergy you've generated so far.

When the captain's lust bar reaches 100%, the night shift ends. The generated sexergy is added to the total.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
